# Summary
In summary, we present a deep neural network classification model that predicts loan applicant success from feature data contained in charity_data.csv with 73% accuracy. 
This does not meet the 75% accuracy target, and the optimization methods employed here have not caused significant improvement.

# Additional Optimization Methods
Performance could increase through additional optimization techniques such as visualizing the numerical feature variable ASK_AMT to find and remove potential outliers that could be causing noise. 

# Alternative Models
An alternative to the deep learning classification model presented in this project could be a Random Forest Classifier. 
It is helpful in that there are less parameters to optimize and those which do require attention are easier to use than those in a neural network.
